DM: Dynamic Model
------------------------------------
Version 1.7
-----------
Fixed maximization
* SRfunctions: standardized covariate treatment to be exp(p*cov)
* SSTfuncDM: removed log transformation of msCoef and flowCoef so that these can be positive or negative
* findOptimum, fndOpt: changed initialization of p to be 0 for msCoef and flowCoef
* createPriors: removed constraint that flowCoef was negative; added upper and lower bounds to msCoef and flowCoef
* throughout: changed flowCoef to be exp(p*cov) same as VRAP

Added centerCov to rav file in place of Debug line.  This tells VRAP to center the covariates in the SR function (in CompRecruits.R)
Replace depth:::med function with Gmedian package function since depth needs X11 package which is not available for unix server.
Added msySpawners to createRAVfile so you can specify specific upper threshold to use.


Version 1.6
-----------
Big clean-up and standardization of naming within functions
All files changed.
Changed arguments for runReport() so it can be used as feeder to Report1() to auto-generate reports.  Added figure captions to runReport().

Changed report generation to use rmarkdown and pandoc so multiple formats can be generated.

Version 1.5
-----------
Added Roxygen documentation

Version 1.4.2
-----------
Addition of shiny app to interact with the package.
